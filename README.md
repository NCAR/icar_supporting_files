# Supporting Files for Running ICAR
Contains larger files that are useful or may be needed to run [ICAR](https://github.com/ncar/icar).  

This provides a place to upload moderately sized binary files for ICAR. For example, binary input files used by different physics packages, sample input and output files, etc.
